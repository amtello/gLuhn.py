gLuhn.py v0.7 - Check/Generate PAN based on Luhn algorithm (c)gfragkos 2013  

usage: gLuhn.py [PAN]
PAN	Given any Primary Account Number (PAN), the application will 
	check if is valid by using the Luhn algorithm.               
	If the PAN contains any number of questionmark (?) characters
	e.g.: 12345555?23412?4, all valid combinations for that PAN  
	will be generated.                                       
                
I couldn't find a tool capable of generating all possible combinations of
valid card numbers (PAN) while specific digits in the PAN are known already.
The tool can be used for validating a single PAN or it can generate all valid 
combinations for a partially known PAN.
