gLuhn.py v0.7 - Check/Generate PAN based on Luhn algorithm (c)gfragkos 2013  

usage: gLuhn.py [PAN]
Given any Primary Account Number (PAN), the application will check if it is valid by using the Luhn algorithm.
If the PAN contains any number of question mark (?) characters e.g.: 12345555?23412?4, all valid combinations for that PAN will be generated.
                
I couldn't find a tool capable of generating all possible combinations of valid card numbers (PAN) while specific digits in the PAN are known already. The tool can be used for validating a single PAN or it can generate all valid combinations for a partially known PAN.
